Conversations for Learning & Exploration in Writing Incident Reports
--
Using conversations in compiling an IT Service incident report. Look for ideas to practice conversation and interview techniques.

As an example, here is a link for study about how conversation is [used in an educational setting, typically language learning](https://preply.com/?campaignid=11945301980&network=g&adgroupid=118721496713&keyword=language%20school&matchtype=b&creative=588921211390&targetid=kwd-10025506&placement=&loc_physical_ms=1009298&device=c&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_term=language%20school&utm_campaign=stu_sem_generic_web_0_eng_jp_multiplesub_xx&hsa_acc=8549349749&hsa_cam=11945301980&hsa_grp=118721496713&hsa_ad=588921211390&hsa_src=g&hsa_tgt=kwd-10025506&hsa_kw=language%20school&hsa_mt=b&hsa_net=adwords&hsa_ver=3&gad_source=1). Preply is an app or service for language learners.


[Interesting example of a physical incident report process](https://www.wolterskluwer.com/en/expert-insights/guidelines-for-witness-interviews-during-an-incident-investigation), and thinking of how to compare it to an IT Service incident report. It features witness interviews to the incident.

Take examples of different incident investigation examples, and also define a conversation as including texts, instant messaging, email and calls, in addition to physical face-to-face conversations.
